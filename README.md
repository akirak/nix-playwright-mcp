# A Nix Flake for Playwright MCP
This aims to be the easiest solution for running [the Playwright MCP
server](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) on NixOS.

This repository packages the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) server in a
Nix flake, so you can run it for
[playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp). It also packages
the Playwright MCP server in Nix, to prevent the error of [Playwright version
mismatch](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp/issues/7).
## Rationale
By early 2025, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging topic among AI
users. Microsoft has released
[playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp), which seems to be
growing in popularity.

Unfortunately, Playwright + Playwright MCP is a little hard to set up on NixOS
for the following reasons:

- [Playwright itself is already confusing on
  NixOS](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/running-playwright-tests/25655), because
  Playwright looks for a browser executable from a specific location on the
  Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which NixOS doesn't adhere to.
- Furthermore, Playwright MCP needs a Playwright server with a specific version
  running in the environment.

By providing both Playwright and the MCP server from a single flake, the above
issues will be resolved!
## Features
- Intuitive and easy to use on NixOS.
- Use the official NixOS package for Playwright browser executables, i.e.
  `playwright-driver-browsers`.
- Include only a single browser executable to minimize the download time.
  Currently, only chromium is supported.
- Also package the MCP server to prevent version issues.
## Usage
To perform anything meaningful with Playwright MCP, you have to run both a
Playwright server and a Playwright MCP server.
### Running a Playwright server
The easiest way is to run the flake directly:

``` shell
nix run github:akirak/nix-playwright-mcp
```

It accepts some command-line options, which you can view by specifying `--help`
as the argument.

The command will print the URL to its WebSocket on console:

> Playwright WebSocket server running on ws://127.0.0.1:39127/

You can set the WebSocket port by specifying `--port` option:

``` shell
nix run github:akirak/nix-playwright-mcp -- --port 39001
```

In this example, the WebSocket endpoint will be `ws://localhost:39001/`.
### Running a MCP server
``` shell
nix run github:akirak/nix-playwright-mcp#mcp-server
```

It accepts the same command-line option as the `@playwright/mcp` package of
[playwright-mcp](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp).

You will probably want to set `PLAYWRIGHT_WS_ENDPOINT` environment variable to
the WebSocket path of the Playwright server, which you can obtain from the
previous console output.
## Technical Details
Because `playwright run-server` is limited in terms of options, this project
provides a custom server executable which wraps the Playwright API.
## Credits
To initially make Playwright run on NixOS, I followed [a thread on the NixOS
Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/running-playwright-tests/25655/). The
posts by Patrizio Bekerle, a.k.a. `pbek`, and Giacomo Debidda, a.k.a. `jackdbd`,
were especially helpful. Thanks!
